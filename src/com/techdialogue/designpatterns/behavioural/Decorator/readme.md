**Introduction**
This pattern helps to attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically.
Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.

It allows behaviour to be added to an individual object,
either statically or dynamically without affecting the behaviour of other objects from the same class.


It is useful for adhering to 
Single Responsibility Principle and Open Closed principle

**Design**
Think of it as a wrapper, with each layer adding new functionality to the previous one
We use inheritance and composition for this design. All the objects created are of same type
